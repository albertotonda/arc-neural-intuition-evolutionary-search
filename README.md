# Neural Intuition + Evolutionary Search for ARC
This repository contains several attempts at using hybrid methods to tackle to ARC challenge. See the README.md file inside the subfolder `/pto-experiments` for the experiments with Program Trace Optimization used in the following publications:

- MORAGLIO A., TONDA A. 2025. 

- MORAGLIO A., TONDA A. 2025. Program Trace Optimization for Language Model Search: the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus Case, In: Proceedings of the annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation (GECCO) 2025 companion, DOI: 10.1145/3712255.3726554

<!-- ## Setup instructions
We are relying upon code created by other people that does not make much sense to keep under version control. For this reason, at the moment the code in the repository starts from the assumption that a `local/` unversioned folder exists, containing other scripts we might need, for example Michale Holdel's DSL and verifiers for the ARC training tasks. So, after cloning this repository:
<!-- 1. Clone or download Hodel's repository at https://github.com/michaelhodel/re-arc to `local/` so that the root folder for the repository is `local/re-arc`
2. Clone or download Chollet's repository at... (maybe not needed?) 
1. From Michael Hodel's repository at https://github.com/michaelhodel/re-arc , obtain `re_arc.zip` and unzip it to `data/`, to create the folder `data/re_arc/tasks` with all the extra tasks created by his generators. -->
