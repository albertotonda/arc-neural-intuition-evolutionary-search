# Neural Intuition + Evolutionary Search for ARC
An attempt to use neural-intuition guided evolutionary search for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC).

## Setup instructions
We are relying upon code created by other people that does not make much sense to keep under version control. For this reason, at the moment the code in the repository starts from the assumption that a `local/` unversioned folder exists, containing other scripts we might need, for example Michale Holdel's DSL and verifiers for the ARC training tasks. So, after cloning this repository:
1. Clone or download Hodel's repository at https://github.com/michaelhodel/re-arc to `local/re-arc`
